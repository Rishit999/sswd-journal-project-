    <h2 class="section-title mb-3">Vendor Policy & Terms</h2>
    <p class="section-subtitle mb-4">
      These policies are written for your engineering project and are inspired by common marketplace
      practices. They are <strong>not legal advice</strong>, but give a realistic structure for how a
      multi‑vendor marketplace like ElectroHub could work.
    </p>

    <!-- Vendor Terms & Conditions -->
    <div id="terms" class="vendor-highlight mb-4 fade-up">
      <h3 class="section-title mb-2" style="font-size:1.3rem;">Vendor Terms & Conditions</h3>

      <h5 class="mb-1">1. Relationship with ElectroHub</h5>
      <p class="small mb-2 text-light">
        ElectroHub operates as a marketplace platform connecting buyers and independent vendors. By registering as a vendor,
        you agree that you are operating as an independent seller, not as an employee or legal representative of ElectroHub.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">2. Responsibility for content & compliance</h5>
      <p class="small mb-2 text-light">
        Vendors are solely responsible for the accuracy of their listings, pricing, stock levels and any legal compliance
        obligations (taxes, safety certifications, warranties, etc.). ElectroHub may moderate or remove content that appears
        to violate law or policy, but is not obligated to do so.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">3. Payments, taxes & invoicing</h5>
      <p class="small mb-2 text-light">
        All payments collected from customers are processed by or on behalf of ElectroHub and then settled to vendors after
        deducting applicable commissions, fees and refunds. Vendors are responsible for issuing valid tax invoices where
        required and for reporting and paying all applicable taxes (such as GST).
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">4. Data usage</h5>
      <p class="small mb-2 text-light">
        ElectroHub may use anonymised and aggregated data about sales, traffic and performance for analytics and product
        improvement. Personal data of customers is handled according to the Privacy Policy and should only be used by vendors
        for order fulfilment and support, not for unrelated marketing without consent.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">5. Limitation of liability</h5>
      <p class="small mb-2 text-light">
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, ElectroHub is not liable for indirect, incidental or consequential damages
        arising from your use of the marketplace. This includes loss of profits, lost data or business interruption. For this
        project implementation, no real financial transactions occur.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">6. Changes to terms</h5>
      <p class="small mb-2 text-light">
        These Vendor Terms &amp; Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the vendor tools constitutes
        acceptance of the updated terms in a real deployment. For this engineering project, you can treat this as a static
        reference document.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">7. Contact</h5>
      <p class="small mb-0 text-light">
        For questions about these terms, vendors can contact
        <strong>vendors@electrohub.demo</strong> or use the vendor support section on the Support page.
